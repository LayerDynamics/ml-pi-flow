help me plan out this project 
ML Model Registry & Tracking (MLflow)
Maintain a lightweight, headless MLflow tracking server for managing experiments, models, and data sets.
with 
TensorBoard Visualization Server
Automatically sync training runs and visualization logs to a centralized headless TensorBoard server.
that also has a 
Local Vector Database for Embedding Search
Host an embedding store (Qdrant or ChromaDB) for semantic searches, used for datasets or codebases.
and also 
 Data Labeling Interface
Serve Label Studio or similar self-hosted labeling systems for annotating your datasets.
and 
Continuous Dataset Validation & Versioning Server
Automate data validation, profiling, and management (e.g., Great Expectations) integrated into ML pipelines.



they will all be completely separate tools developed separately to be used on the rpi 5 8gb and a 512gb nvme m key storage 

i want a dashboard that will be just a display(separate from all projects but includes metrics and info from all of them)

a web portal for interacting and viewing the projects that i can connect to via locally on the same network 

include architecture visuals, folder architecture diagrams with files and their descriptions and how how and what they interact with 


you must include completely different sections for each project
